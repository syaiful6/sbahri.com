You know the first time you follow a programming tutorial and it tells you to print "Hello, World!" to the console? Well, consider this my version of that classic exercise.

I'am an Indonesian. English is not my first language. I struggle explaining myself in English. So, please bear with me.

At the time of writing this post, I have been coding for more than 15 years. I started learning programming when I was in high school. Over the years, I've dabbled in various programming languages and technologies, from PHP Python, Haskell to OCaml. I built web applications, desktop and mobile apps.
