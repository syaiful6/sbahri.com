You know the first time you follow a programming tutorial and it tells you to print "Hello, World!" to the console? Well, consider this my version of that classic exercise.

I am an Indonesian and English is not my first language, so I sometimes struggle to explain myself clearly. Please bear with me.

At the time of writing this post, I have been coding for more than 15 years. Over the years, I've dabbled in various programming languages
and technologies, from PHP, Python, and Haskell to OCaml. I've built web, desktop, and mobile applications.

I've wanted to start a blog for a long time to share my experiences in software development and technology—what I've learned, the challenges I've faced, and the solutions I've found along the way. 
However, I always hesitated, worried about my English skills and whether my thoughts would be interesting to others.

This is the start of my blogging journey. I hope you find my posts informative and engaging. If you have any questions or topics you'd like me to cover, feel free to reach out!
